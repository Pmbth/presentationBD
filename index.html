                <p class="lead"><strong>Beer, babes and baller status await once you achieve your true masculine potential.</strong></p>
                <p>Picture a legendary hero from the past. Do you see a tall, muscular Viking with a full beard or a baby-faced boy who can’t even hold an axe?</p>
                <p>Yep, it’s the Viking every time.</p>

                <p>It’s every guy’s dream to have a beard like your ancestors. However, your genes might be working against you.</p>

                <p>If you have trouble growing a manly beard or can’t seem to fill in the gaps between your whiskers, you might need a little help from experts to achieve your full facial hair potential. I know that I did.</p>

                <p>If you’ve already tried some other methods (think something that rhymes with “schmogaine”), only to be met with disappointing failure, I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>

                <p>I used to be that guy — baby-faced and alone on Friday nights. I couldn’t pick up a girl to save my life! All it took was one look at my stubble-free face and every girl at the bar would end up leaving with a hipster with a full beard and man bun instead. You know the type — the guys who look like lumberjacks with a perfectly oiled mustache and a plaid flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a “Mom” tattoo on his bicep.</p>

                <p>After countless weekends of heading home alone, I decided that I had to do something.</p>

                <p>I started searching online for shampoos, lotions, anything that would help me overcome my genes and achieve my wildest beard dreams. I had the desire, but not the natural ability to grow a beard of my own. I found tons of things that promised me results, but after doing a little digging, everything ended up looking more and more like a scam.</p>

                <h3>That's When I found <?php echo $NAME1; ?>  >>  <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank">Try it Now</a></h3>

                <p><a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank"><?php echo $NAME1; ?></a> is an awesome, brand new supplement that uses tried-and-true scientific breakthroughs to provide:</p>
                <ul class="content">
                    <li>Fuller & longer beards</li>
                    <li>Fewer gray hairs</li>
                    <li>Healthy & shiny facial hair</li>
                    <li>Less beard dandruff and breakouts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It sounded too good to be true, but after looking into it a little more, it looked legit enough to try for myself. I ordered my <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank">risk-free trial</a> and waited for it to arrive.</p>

                <p>In just a few days, I got my <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank"><?php echo $NAME1; ?></a> package in the mail. I took my first capsule immediately and waited to see what would happen. Over the next few days, I kept taking my capsule every morning and went about my normal routine.</p>

                <p>After the weekend was over, I woke up, stretched, scratched my face and… wait… what was that? Is that stubble?</p>

                <p>I ran to the bathroom mirror to see for myself. My chin and cheeks were covered with an even coat of dark, healthy looking hairs. It was like a 5 o’clock shadow — at 8 a.m.!</p>

                <p>I headed to work and was shocked to catch more than a few ladies looking at me as I walked to my building. I had never gotten so much attention before. Even the barista at my regular coffee shop looked at me and said “Something is different about you… you look great today! What have you done differently?” </p>

                <p>I just smiled and got my coffee to-go.</p>

                <p>That night, I wanted to try out my newfound beard. Sure, it was just in the beginning stages, but after my morning success, I wanted to see it in action after hours! I headed to my regular bar down the street to meet a few friends — each of which complimented me on my newly grown facial hair. My confidence was skyrocketing.</p>

                <p>After another week or two, I didn’t just have stubble. I had a <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank">full-blown thick beard</a> that any Hollywood celeb would envy. I honestly couldn’t believe how well <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank"><?php echo $NAME1; ?></a> had worked. I was regularly getting girls’ numbers and going out on dates almost every night. I actually went on more dates than when I had when I was in college!</p>

                <p>Seriously, if it worked for me, there’s no way it won’t work for you. If you want to pump up your beard to the next level, <?php echo $NAME1; ?> is the only thing out there that works. </p>

                <h3>How <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank"><?php echo $NAME1; ?> Works</a></h3>

                <p>You might be asking - why is having a full, thick beard so important? </p>

                <p>Well, for starters you will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enjoy instant sex appeal</li>
                    <li>Get respect from coworkers and friends</li>
                    <li>Give off an aura of wisdom and experience</li>
                    <li>Act as a role model for younger men</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Should I Try <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank"><?php echo $NAME1; ?>?</a></h3>

                <p>If you've ever said these...</p>

                <blockquote>“Girls only like guys with awesome beards.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“I want to look older, more mature.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“My beard looks great, but itches way too much to maintain.”</blockquote>

                <p>… then it’s time to say goodbye to excuses and say hello to a 5 o’clock shadow by noon. I tried tons of different ways to grow my beard. I changed my diet, I used special shampoo, and I even went in for surgery. None of these treatments worked as well or as fast as <?php echo $NAME1; ?>.</p>

                <p>Before I even finished my <a href="<?php echo $OFFER1; ?>" target="_blank">trial bottle of <?php echo $NAME1; ?>,</a> I had already ordered three more. Now that I have the beard I’ve always wanted, I’m going to do everything I can to keep it. And it’s easy with <?php echo $NAME1; ?>!</p>

                        I am not the kind of guy to walk in to department stores and have girls half my age try and sell me some fad products. I did my research on <?php echo $NAME1; ?>, and decided to give the trial offer a shot. I am so far VERY pleased with the results, they def have helped grow my facial hair thicker. <?php echo $NAME1; ?> says the best benefits happen after a few months of use, but I am only on my 3rd week. So far so good, will keep trying it out!

                        <?php echo $NAME1; ?> and <?php echo $NAME2; ?> is exactly what I’ve been looking for. it actually works and has significantly reduced the itching skin along my jaw while my beard grows.
